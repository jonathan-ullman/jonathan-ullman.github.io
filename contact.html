							<p><b>Interested in working with me as an undergraduate?</b> That's great, I love working with undergraduates when possible.  My suggestion is to first contact <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/benjamin-hescott/">Ben Hescott</a>, who can tell you more about the different ways of getting involved in research as an undergraduate, and can help direct you to different faculty members whose research might be a good fit.  If you're interested in theory research, feel free to contact me and let me know about your background and  what got you interested you in research.</p>
							
							<p><b>Interested in working with me as an MS student?</b> I typically do not have RA positions for MS students.  If you have specific research experience or academic background that is related to my research, feel free to send me a short message about it.</p>
							
							<p><b>Interested in being my TA?</b> That's great!  All our TAs are selected using a central application process, so please submit and application and mark my course as one that you are interested in.</p>
